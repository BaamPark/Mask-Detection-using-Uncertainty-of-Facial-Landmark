# Mask-Detection-using-Uncertainty-of-Facial-Landmark

## Introduction
Facial landmarks are key features of human facial image, which generally represent 68 points of facial region 
such as eyes, nose, mouth, and contour of chin. We propose novel mask detection using facial landmark assessment. We use LUVLi (the joint estimation of landmark location, uncertainty, and visibility likelihood )
network to estimate uncertainty of predicted facial landmark on masked face dataset. 
We implement a machine learning model to classify whether mask is present or absent
